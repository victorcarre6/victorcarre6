# Hello there ! I'm Victor – PhD in Organic Chemistry

Exploring the intersection of chemistry, data science, and AI models. 

I design open-source tools that combine scientific rigor and digital innovation. 
From molecular discovery to AI-powered assistants, my goal is to help scientists push the boundaries of their research.  

I am independant, and always open to collaborations.

## My Interests  

- Machine learning for chemistry and molecular discovery
- Photochemistry, photocatalysis and light-driven processes
- Biostimulants and sustainable agriculture through data-driven insights  
- Intelligent assistants and productivity tools for science (LLMs, automation, dashboards)

---
  
## Active Projects 

- [Local LLM Memorization](https://github.com/victorcarre6/llm-memorization)
  
A project aiming to enhance interactions with local models by automatically memorizing and summarizing past conversations to generate precise and context-aware prompts.

- [LocalMind](https://github.com/victorcarre6/llm-assistant)

A chat interface to discuss with local models that maintain persistent memory, based on Local LLM Memorization with automatic update and retrieving of memory.

- [Reaction Optimization Tool](https://github.com/victorcarre6/reaction-optimization-tool) (WIP)

This project aims to develop an interface for the prediction of chemical reaction yields by combining molecular structure information, experimental conditions and ùachine learning models.

- [Photocompounds Database](https://github.com/victorcarre6/photocompounds-database) (WIP)

A comprehensive database for artificial photosynthesis molecules and photocatalytic systems, with a focus on biomass valorization. 

## Future Projects (Currently Private)

- [Photocompounds Properties Predictor](https://github.com/victorcarre6/photocompounds-properties-predictor)

A project aiming to predict the properties, stability, and efficiency of photocompounds, using a homemade dataset.

- [Biostimulants Database](https://github.com/victorcarre6/biostimulants-database)

An open-source repository for biostimulants and active compounds from bio-sources.  

- [Biostimulant Formulation Predictor](https://github.com/victorcarre6/biostimulant-formulation-predictor)  

An AI-powered tool for predicting optimal biostimulant formulations, integrating chemical, biological, and agronomic data for maximum efficacy.
