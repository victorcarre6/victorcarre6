## Active Projects 

- [Local LLM Memorization](https://github.com/victorcarre6/llm-memorization)
  
A project aiming to enhance interactions with local models by automatically memorizing and summarizing past conversations to generate precise and context-aware prompts.

- [Reaction Optimizer Tool](https://github.com/victorcarre6/reaction-optimizer-tool)

This project aims to develop an interface for the prediction of chemical reaction yields by combining molecular structure information, experimental conditions and ùachine learning models.

- [Photocompounds Database](https://github.com/victorcarre6/photocompounds-database)

A comprehensive database for artificial photosynthesis molecules and photocatalytic systems, with a focus on biomass valorization. 

## Future Projects (Currently Private)

- [Photocompounds Properties Predictor](https://github.com/victorcarre6/photocompounds-properties-predictor)

A project aiming to predict the properties, stability, and efficiency of photocompounds, using a homemade dataset. 
- [Biostimulants Database](https://github.com/victorcarre6/biostimulants-database)

An open-source repository for biostimulants and active compounds from bio-sources.  

- [Biostimulant Formulation Predictor](https://github.com/victorcarre6/biostimulant-formulation-predictor)  

An AI-powered tool for predicting optimal biostimulant formulations, integrating chemical, biological, and agronomic data for maximum efficacy.
